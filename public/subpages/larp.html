        <p class="px-10"><span class="metamorphous-regular">Nick O'Brien</span> participates in two main LARP events, <a href="https://www.weekendwarriorexperience.com/" style="color: #2a4365;">Weekend Warrior Experience</a> and <a href="https://warofthebarons.com/" style="color: #2a4365;">War of the Barons</a>.
            Both are quite a hike from his native New York, all the way down in South Carolina, but he's found them to be <span style="font-style: italic;">well</span> worth the journey. After all, journey before destination! He's on the hunt for other LARP events that he's able to fit into his schedule- alas,
            at the moment, finding the time to take off from work is quite the challenge! So far, he's only attended Weekend Warrior Experience and War of the Barons once each, but had the time of his life at each.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="px-10">At Weekend Warrior Experience, he plays the character of Harald- a humble fisherman from the nation of Throi who's joined the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thesealords/" style="color: #2a4365;">Sea Lords</a> to protect his country and kin from those who would do them harm. Harald may not be the most experienced warrior on the field,
            but his enemies know to flee when they see his sigil of three rats emblazoned on his shield from across the line! He serves on the Leviathan, under Captain Omaadi, and is proud to serve both his captain and country.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="px-10">Unlike Weekend Warrior Experience's low fantasy setting, War of the Barons is more of a historical fiction event, based around the First Barons' War in Medieval England. At this event, Nick plays the character of Ludwig. Ludwig is a Flemish mercenary hired to fight against
            the tyrant King John by the rebel Baroness Eleanor of Gloucester. However, Ludwig has a second, secret mission on hand from his lord in Flanders- fight to overthrow the Norman dynasty entirely so that a Saxon king can be reinstated upon the throne of England! Ludwig will likely
            never see this goal come to fruition, but if he's going to go down, he may as well take as many Normans with him as possible!
