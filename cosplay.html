        <p class="px-10"><span class="metamorphous-regular">Nick O'Brien</span> specializes in historical and historical fantasy cosplay. Among his favorite builds are a "mostly-accurate" Viking, a "historically-plausible" fantasy knight,
            a 1st Century BC Roman legionary, Ludwig (an early 13th Century inspired mercenary for one of his LARP events), and Harald (possibly his most popular build, a Norman-esque fantasy character for his other main LARP event, pictured directly to the side here).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="px-10">One thing that Nick takes great pride in his that he personally crafts a good deal of his kit. Originally, this started at the suggestion of a friend due to his difficulty in finding things that were a good fit,
            and also that were what he was going for visually and materially. This quickly evolved into a love of the craft, both as a way for him to express himself, but also as a way to keep his brain occupied and learn new things.

                <p class="px-10 font-regular">Harald is a Norman-esque fantasy character he built for one of his two main LARP events, <a href="https://www.weekendwarriorexperience.com/" style="color: #2a4365;">Weekend Warrior Experience</a>. This fearsome fisherman joined the famous Throian navy to defend his homeland from those who would do it and its people harm.
                    Clad in various shades of blue, his personal sigil of the rat can be found both stitched into his clothing, as well as painted across his shield. A fierce warrior, proficient with both the sword and spear,
                    his enemies know to flee when they see the rat sigil on the battlefield!

                <p class="px-10 font-regular">Nick's Viking build is what he refers to as "mostly-accurate." While not a <span class="macondo-regular">completely</span> faithful reconstruction of a Viking, it gets many of the overall appearances fairly accurate for a 9th- or 10th-Century Viking (depending on which sword Nick is using).
                    It was one of the very first characters Nick put together, and is probably his most-used cosplay. It also has the first two pieces Nick ever made- a slightly padded tunic to wear over his main tunic and under his maille, and his famous rat shield.

                <p class="px-10 font-regular">The 1st Century BC Roman legionary is Nick's newest addition and was an instant favorite not only for him, but also among his friends. It's also probably his most historically authentic cosplay to date- not only is the majority of the kit more or less faithful to that of a Roman legionary from
                    the late 1st Century BC, but he also hand-made his tunic using historical techniques, from dyeing it himself using natural dyes, to hand-stitching it with historically accurate thread. From when the idea of cosplaying first started rattling around in his head, this was a character he always wanted to do, and is thrilled
                    that he's finally had the chance to put him together.

                <p class="px-10 font-regular">Very rarely does Nick venture into pure fantasy with his characters. The knight is one such example of this. However, even in his fantasy designs, Nick still likes to keep them what he refers to as "historically plausible." You can see this in the cuts of clothing used, in the way the knight
                    has his armor in layers, and the type of sword used. Even if individual pieces may be anachronistic to one another, they still don't scream "modern sensibilities" at all (well... mostly. The plate armor is fairly nonsensical from a historical standpoint).

                <p class="px-10 font-regular">Ludwig (pictured in red) is Nick's other main LARP build, designed for <a href="https://warofthebarons.com/" style="color: #2a4365;">War of the Barons</a>, where he fights for the rebel cause under the command of the Baroness of Gloucester. Ludwig was an incredibly fun build for Nick, as he
                    had to balance historical authenticity of an early 13th Century Man-at-Arms with the practicality of a LARP event with strict parameters on kit. Nick also had quite a bit of fun with Ludwig as he made much of the soft kit for the character himself, as well as painted his shield.
