        <p class="px-10"><span class="metamorphous-regular">Nick O'Brien</span> specializes in historical and historical fantasy cosplay. Among his favorite builds are a "mostly-accurate" viking, a "historically-plausible" fantasy knight,
            a 1st Century BC Roman legionary, Ludwig (an early 13th-century inspired mercenary for one of his LARP events), and Harald (possibly his most popular build, a Norman-esque fantasy character for his other main LARP event, pictured directly to the side here).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="px-10">One thing that Nick takes great pride in his that he personally crafts a good deal of his kit. Originally, this started at the suggestion of a friend due to his difficulty in finding things that were a good fit,
            and also that were what he was going for visually and materially. This quickly evolved into a love of the craft, both as a way for him to express himself, but also as a way to keep his brain occupied and learn new things.

                    <p class="px-10 font-regular">Harald is a Norman-esque fantasy character he built for one of his two main LARP events, Weekend Warrior Experience. This fearsome fisherman joined the famous Throian navy to defend his homeland from those who would do it and its people harm.
                        Clad in various shades of blue, his personal sigil of the rat can be found both stitched into his clothing, as well as painted across his shield. A fierce warrior, proficient with both the sword and spear,
                        his enemies know to flee when they see the rat sigil on the battlefield!
