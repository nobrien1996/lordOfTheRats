        <p><span class="text-3xl metamorphous-regular">Nick O'Brien</span> is a cosplayer, LARPer, crafter, and general history and fantasy nerd from New York State. After many, <span class="italic">many, </span><span class="italic, font-semibold">MANY </span>
            years of being told "You can do that when you're an adult," he finally realized that he was, in fact, an <span class="macondo-regular text-xl">Adult </span>and could play around with all the things he'd always wanted!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Not only does Nick cosplay all sorts of fantasy and historical original characters, but he makes a significant portion of his kit- from clothing to arming wear to accessories, he's always out to learn new skills to add to his repertoire.
            His latest projects have had him using natural dyes on natural fibers, making shields, hand-embroidering, recreating historical garments, and more.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>He has many new and exciting projects coming up, both on his own, as well as with friends, that he's very excited to reveal to the world when they're ready! Be sure to catch fan-favorite of his, Harald, on an "unexpected"
            run-in with a certain queen of the seas. When the humble fisherman turned soldier meets a primordial goddess, who knows what will happen next? Also coming later this summer is another team-up of equally epic proportions,
            as well as some upgrades and some revisiting of some of his most popular cosplays yet!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>When Nick isn't creating new cosplays, LARPing, or otherwise embracing his inner 10-year-old, he can often be found with some sort of animal, curled up in his dungeon writing, or creating music. He's been a musician for nearly three decades now, playing several instruments and composing. 
            He's also the doting father to two bunnies, some rats, a ball python, and many fish, and also harbors not-so-secret dreams of becoming a writer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>An ardent lover of history just as much as fantasy, Nick has lots of fun toeing the line between historically accurate and historically feasible cosplay. Every design for a new character that goes through his head is filtered into either the "historically accurate" recreation of (fictional) 
            historical characters, or "historically feasible" creations of original characters who are pure fantasy. In other words, if it's not trying to recreate something specific from history, Nick wants to make sure it at least wouldn't look too out of place in history!
